# Object Detection using OpenCV

This is a Python script that uses OpenCV to detect objects in real-time using a webcam. 

## Getting Started

To run this script, you will need to have OpenCV installed on your machine. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

You will also need to download the XML file for the object you want to detect and update the file path in the script to match the location on your machine.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the following command:


```
python OpenCV.py
```
This will open up your webcam and start detecting the object in real-time. Press 'q' to quit the script.

## Example

Here's an example of what the object detection looks like:
